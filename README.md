# DnD-Ultimate-Experience-Tool
differend tools contributing to the ultimate DnD experience
The whole project is devided in a few differend phases, with the priority on the most 'realistic' and easiest to implement.



Phase 1 : DM immersive experience tool

Based on the feedback we get of interviews with DM's and players we design a dashboard as tool for the DM's were they can build
their own scenes they going to use in their session. Each scene will be filled with content based on the earlier obtained feedback.
This tool is done when all data can get handle throughout the database, and when the selected scene is able to stream towards a 
pre-selected device. 
(everything is account bound)



Phase 2 : DM Interactive Digital-Tabletop-Board

To put this easily, imagen a tv laying on its back so the screen is facing upward and now call it the board. 
The DM will be able to draw on this board by drag-and-drop houses (and maybe mobs) on it, and the DM is able to draw boundaries 
(obstacles) The whole field is underdevided in a grid so the players can still navigate on it with their characters.



Phase 3 : Digital Interactive Charactersheet

We want to change the papermess everyone refers to as 'charactersheet'. Most sessions this sheets get abused or when taken home get more
abused or even get lost. We intent to change this to digitalize this sheet into an application. Many hours will be spend into analysing 
these charactersheets on their data and how we can display this on the most optimalized way possible on a mobile phone.



Phase 4 : Improve And Optimalize

With the basic tools done we now focus on making the experience totally rememberable. 
Instead of a mere tv placed in the room we now really dig in on the whole immersive experience and boi de we have an idea.

We plan to use 'mapping', mapping is the art of projecting on surfaces. Now imagen this to be done in a round room, and to make it even 
better... 360 degrees... ye, all around the room. To top it of we can hook this up to some interactive lights that shiftes colours
depending on the main colour of the set background.



Phase 5 : Combine It All

If I tought it well thrue. We now have all the tools to design every DnD session with these tools fairly easy on both sides (makeing
and executing). And ofcourse for both the parties (the DM & the playerbase) every session held in such a DnD room will be truely
un...
for...
get...
able...



Phase 6 : Fund Me To Build

If everything works fine we should implement this and see how popular this would really get. I'm certain there is a massive playerbase
out there for DnD that is just sitting at home whishing they had a party to play with.

For them and everyone already playing I wish to create a building that houses the DnD community.
